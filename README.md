# Archeology-of-the-Present
Sand Box and projection mapping

Archeology of the Present; San Box, is a sensitive surface structure with photo resistors coupled in six groups of three.
The code calls out video projections to be played on top of the sand. Tanner Settles as creator, with help from Nathan Villicana-Shaw and Bibiana Bauer.

We chose to tell humorous, serious, and empowering stories of the year in 2017.  We wanted to show these stories on an interactive platform (Sand Box) that invites an audience to dig and uncover such stories so that they may reflect and take away helpful advise with them into the next year.

Success for us is to see the laughter and enjoyment of our audience play with the sand and reflect on the video projections in a way that leaves them shocked, humored, or pondering the stories presented and the advice exchanged.
